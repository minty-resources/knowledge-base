* **xkill**
  In case a window becomes unresponsive, start xkill and click into that window. This will kill the underlying process tree.

* **htop**  
  Terminal based task manager for monitoring resource consumption of current processes, or just to stop running processes \(also great for testing graceful shutdown of node applications\)

* **jq**  
  Command line JSON transformations \(e.g. for picking sub-properties from some biggger JSON input, works great with pipelining \([https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\)\)
